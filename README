1. INTRODUCTION
Mobius Forensic Toolkit is an open-source forensic framework written in
C++ and Python/GTK that manages cases and case items, providing an abstract
interface for developing extensions. Cases and item categories are defined
using XML files, for easy integration with other tools.


2. INSTALLATION

./configure --with-libtsk=<SLEUTHKIT_DIR>
make
su -c 'make install'

* <SLEUTHKIT_DIR> is the directory where sleuthkit has been installed.
Use --without-sleuthkit to build the C++ API without support to the
sleuthkit libraries.


3. USAGE
Run mobius_bin.py.
